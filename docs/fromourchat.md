I'm glad to hear that! Starting with a strong foundation ensures a smoother development process down the line.

Given our discussions so far, let's begin with the **Foundation** and **Core** aspects of the tool.

### Initial Setup:

1. **Environment Setup:** Before diving into the code, ensure you have the necessary environment set up. This includes Python 3, FFmpeg, OpenImageIO, and any other required libraries or tools.

2. **Directory Structure:** Within the repository, set up directories for the source code, configurations, test data, logs, etc. A possible structure could be:

```
/movMaker
  /src  # Source code
    /managers  # Individual manager modules
  /configs  # Configuration files
  /logs  # Debugging logs
  /tests  # Test image sequences, scripts, etc.
```

3. **Base Script:** Create a base script (e.g., `movmaker.py`) that will serve as the main entry point for the CLI tool. This script will handle command-line arguments, invoke the necessary managers, and provide feedback to the user.

### Development:

1. **Configuration Manager:**
   - Start by developing the capability to read and interpret CSV configuration files.
   - This manager will serve as the source of truth for how the tool behaves, so ensuring accurate and flexible configuration reading is crucial.

2. **Image Sequence Loader:**
   - Develop the functionality to load and validate image sequences.
   - Ensure the sequences meet the specified criteria (format, bit-depth, etc.).

3. **Processing Manager & Transform Manager:**
   - Begin with basic transformations like scaling or rotating.
   - As the development progresses, incorporate more advanced processing like LUT application, colorspace conversions, etc.

4. **User Communication Manager:**
   - Implement basic feedback mechanisms like console outputs.
   - Add a verbose mode for detailed logging for debugging purposes.

5. **Integration with External Utilities:**
   - Develop the functionality to call FFmpeg or OpenImageIO for specific tasks.
   - Ensure smooth integration and error handling.

6. **Iterative Testing:**
   - Continuously test each component as it's developed.
   - Use sample image sequences to validate the tool's behavior.

By building out these core components iteratively, you'll have a functioning prototype of `movMaker`. As we progress, we can refine, optimize, and expand upon these functionalities.

I'll guide you through each step, providing code snippets, explanations, and best practices. Let's start with the **Configuration Manager**. Are you ready?
