I'm glad to hear that! Starting with a strong foundation ensures a smoother development process down the line.

Given our discussions so far, let's begin with the **Foundation** and **Core** aspects of the tool.

### Initial Setup:

1. **Environment Setup:** Before diving into the code, ensure you have the necessary environment set up. This includes Python 3, FFmpeg, OpenImageIO, and any other required libraries or tools.

2. **Directory Structure:** Within the repository, set up directories for the source code, configurations, test data, logs, etc. A possible structure could be:

```
/movMaker
  /src  # Source code
    /managers  # Individual manager modules
  /configs  # Configuration files
  /logs  # Debugging logs
  /tests  # Test image sequences, scripts, etc.
```

3. **Base Script:** Create a base script (e.g., `movmaker.py`) that will serve as the main entry point for the CLI tool. This script will handle command-line arguments, invoke the necessary managers, and provide feedback to the user.

### Development:

1. **Configuration Manager:**
   - Start by developing the capability to read and interpret CSV configuration files.
   - This manager will serve as the source of truth for how the tool behaves, so ensuring accurate and flexible configuration reading is crucial.

2. **Image Sequence Loader:**
   - Develop the functionality to load and validate image sequences.
   - Ensure the sequences meet the specified criteria (format, bit-depth, etc.).

3. **Processing Manager & Transform Manager:**
   - Begin with basic transformations like scaling or rotating.
   - As the development progresses, incorporate more advanced processing like LUT application, colorspace conversions, etc.

4. **User Communication Manager:**
   - Implement basic feedback mechanisms like console outputs.
   - Add a verbose mode for detailed logging for debugging purposes.

5. **Integration with External Utilities:**
   - Develop the functionality to call FFmpeg or OpenImageIO for specific tasks.
   - Ensure smooth integration and error handling.

6. **Iterative Testing:**
   - Continuously test each component as it's developed.
   - Use sample image sequences to validate the tool's behavior.

By building out these core components iteratively, you'll have a functioning prototype of `movMaker`. As we progress, we can refine, optimize, and expand upon these functionalities.

I'll guide you through each step, providing code snippets, explanations, and best practices. Let's start with the **Configuration Manager**. Are you ready?


 a single file in a sequence is made of 2 rigid points, the periods/full stops, connected by 3 indestructible and inflexible components, each completely independent, each available for use anywhere else and without constraint. someone putting these 5 things together this same way will always have created a sequence. even if they don't know what a sequence is. the first componenent is the name which is a sequence of grouped characters a-z, A-Z and 0-9 which may use _ (underscore) or - (hyphen/dash/minus sign) as separators, no other chars. the second component is an integer presented in padded format. the third and final component is the extension the particular type of file is given when it was created.
- a sequence is a collection of files with the following things in common, name must be identical, extension must be identical, number must have identical padding but the integer must be unique to each file.

4 steps to check input is valid sequence data

1 - how many periods are there?
2 - if 2 the what separates them?
3 - if integers, then is what's after the second period an extension? (you can make this as simple as checking for 3-4 characters without worrying their validity for now)
4 - if it is then are are the characters ahead of the first/left side period alphanumeric with _- and nothing else?

passes these in this exact order then it's good to use.

we can get even more rigid. put the components which make up a sequence as i described above in order of efficiency for a typical pc to deal with. i was incredibly specific, enough so that failure of any single thing means no further work need be done. for instance, if you start with the first letter of the name and find no files which have that as their first letter then that sequence is not there. but i expect there will be times when the first thing to do would be to find all the files with 2 periods separated by 4 integers, an outlier but certainly useful when 4-padded sequences are mixed in with 7, 8 and 9 padded ones (those are always 1000s of frames long too as they're always raw export from DI). You'd know better than me but maybe certain filesystems will do the heavy lifting and supply files of the same type without blinking - again, a bit of an outlier as almost every instance the image sequence will be alone in its own directory ;-)

1 - extension
2 - period ahead of the extension must have an integer to its left otherwise discard
3 - next period left of the first and only integers separateing them, chuck anything with non-integer chars (that includes spaces and also nothing, ie "..ext")
4 - padding - no sorting, this just throws away non-matching padded numbers
5 - filename - start with first and simply iterate through to the first period, throw anything left away



by defining the name of a sequence this way:

"any file names its sequence"

instead of:

"The name of a sequence is derived from the common base name shared by the files in the sequence."

a load of things are possible.
Put another way, if you define the name of a sequence this way:

"The name of a sequence is derived from the common base name shared by the files in the sequence."

instead of:

"any file names its sequence"

a lot of things become impossible.
go back and read my explanation and this time consider that if we set rigid, immovable points in place and connect those using components which are indestructible and inflexible we create the most flexible and limitless environment for creating
