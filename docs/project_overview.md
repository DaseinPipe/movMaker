Introduction:

movMaker is a specialized tool tailored for professionals in the VFX and digital content creation community. It provides an efficient and customizable workflow to convert image sequences into MOV files. Recognizing the varied requirements of different projects, movMaker is designed to be both user-friendly for straightforward tasks and powerful enough for advanced use cases.
Purpose:

While there are various tools available for video conversion, movMaker stands out by specifically addressing the unique needs of the VFX community. It acknowledges the intricacies of working with high-quality image sequences, diverse colorspaces, and the necessity for accurate color reproduction. The tool:

    Supports a range of image formats, including but not limited to cin, dpx, exr, jpg/jpeg, tif/tiff, png, and tga.
    Accommodates different bit depths and colorspaces, such as 8-bit, 10-bit, 12-bit, 16-bit, half-float, full-float, linear, rec709, log, and aces-cg/scene linear.
    Allows the application of one or more LUTs to each frame before encoding.
    Provides functionalities like adding slates, overlaying burn-in text, and inserting timecodes.
    Integrates with external utilities like FFmpeg and OpenImageIO for specialized tasks.

Key Concepts:

At its core, movMaker operates using a modular architecture. The tool is built around multiple managers or modules, each with its distinct responsibilities:

    - Configuration Manager: Interprets user-defined configurations provided through CSV files.
    
    - Image Sequence Loader: Acts as the entry point, ingesting image sequences and ensuring they meet the specified criteria.
    
    - Processing Manager: Applies a series of transformations, color adjustments, and other processing steps based on user configurations.
    
    - Transform Manager: Essential for visual adjustments, this manager handles geometric transformations on the image sequences. Whether it's scaling to fit a specific resolution, rotating, or translating, the Transform Manager ensures the content looks right. Additionally, it manages aspect ratio corrections, offering functionalities like letterboxing or pillarboxing to fit images into desired output dimensions without distortion.

    - LUT and Colorspace Manager: Responsible for accurate color representation, this manager applies specified LUTs and facilitates colorspace conversions, ensuring the visual integrity of the content.

    - Text and Slate Manager: Enhances the output video by allowing users to overlay burn-in text on each frame or insert slates, offering customization options for content and appearance.

    - Timecode Manager: Essential for synchronization and professional workflows, this manager embeds accurate timecode information into the MOV output, aligning with industry standards.

    - Video Encoder: The final step in the pipeline, this manager takes the processed image sequences and encodes them into the MOV format. It ensures that the output adheres to the desired frame rate and offers quality adjustments to fit different use cases.

    - Utility Integrator: Serving as a bridge to third-party tools, this manager seamlessly integrates functionalities from external utilities like FFmpeg and OpenImageIO, extending the capabilities of movMaker.

    - Output Manager: Beyond just final outputs, this manager handles the writing of intermediate sequences to disk, aiding in caching and potential debugging. It offers configurability in terms of output paths and formats.

    - User Communication Manager: Serving as the primary channel of interaction between movMaker and its users, this manager handles all forms of feedback and communication. Whether it's providing high-level progress updates, displaying user-friendly notifications, or logging detailed debugging information, the User Communication Manager ensures clarity and transparency in all operations. In a command-line context, it manages console outputs, offering both concise and verbose modes to cater to different user needs. As the tool evolves, this manager can also be extended to handle GUI-based interactions, ensuring consistent and user-centric communication across all interfaces.

This modular approach ensures flexibility, allowing users to define custom workflows tailored to their specific needs. Furthermore, it supports future expansions, making it possible to introduce new features or improve existing ones without disrupting the overall system.
