------------

    Input Images (Client Property): These are the raw materials. They are valuable assets provided by the client, often containing detailed information in high-quality formats like EXR. They represent the "source of truth" and need to be treated with the utmost care to preserve their integrity.

    MOV Outputs (Product): These are the results of processing the client's assets using movMaker. These MOV files are tailored to the client's specifications and are optimized for their intended use, be it high-quality archival, editing, distribution, or preview. They are the tangible deliverables that the client receives after entrusting their assets to movMaker.

With this perspective, the importance of ensuring that movMaker processes the input images accurately, efficiently, and according to the specified requirements becomes even more evident. It reinforces the need for a robust and flexible system that can cater to diverse client needs while maintaining the quality and integrity of their assets.

It also emphasizes the value of effective communication (via user-friendly interfaces, logs, feedback, etc.) so that users have confidence in the product creation process and are assured that their assets are being treated correctly.
